# 3dscanner
The aim of this project is to build a circular adjustable frame holding a 3D scanner. This allows you to enhance the result of scanning people 's heads and objects. In the process of scanning the 3D scanner will move around the target object by an engine. In addition the scanning motion of the construct is synchronized with the scanning software itself.
