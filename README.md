# 3dscanner
The aim of this project is to build a circular adjustable frame holding a 3D scanner. This allows you to enhance the result of scanning people 's heads or various small to medium sized objects. In the process of scanning the 3D scanner will move around the target object by an engine. In addition the scanning motion of the construct is synchronized with the scanning software itself. The project is implemented by students of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria Campus Hagenberg and so the resulting product is property of the University as well.
